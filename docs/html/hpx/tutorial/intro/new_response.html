<p>
          Today's computer systems are designed based on the initial ideas of <a href="http://qss.stanford.edu/~godfrey/vonNeumann/vnedvac.pdf" target="_top">John von
          Neumann</a>, as published back in 1945, and later extended by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture" target="_top">Harvard
          architecture</a>. These ideas form the foundation, the execution model
          of computer systems we use currently. But apparently a new response is
          required in the light of the demands created by today's technology.
        </p>
<p>
          So, what are the overarching objectives for designing systems allowing
          for applications to scale as they should? In our opinion, the main objectives
          are:
        </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Performance</em></span>: as mentioned, scalable and efficiency
              are the main criteria people are interested in
            </li>
<li class="listitem">
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Fault tolerance</em></span>: the low expected mean time between
              failures (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_between_failures" target="_top">MTBF</a>)
              of future systems requires to embrace faults, not trying to avoid them
            </li>
<li class="listitem">
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Power</em></span>: minimizing energy consumption is a must
              as it is one of the major cost factors today, even more so in the future
            </li>
<li class="listitem">
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Generality</em></span>: any system should be usable for a
              broad set of use cases
            </li>
<li class="listitem">
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Programmability</em></span>: for me as a programmer this is
              a very important objective, ensuring long term platform stability and
              portability
            </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
          What needs to be done to meet those objectives, to make applications scale
          better on tomorrow's architectures? Well, the answer is almost obvious:
          we need to devise a new execution model - a set of governing principles
          for the holistic design of future systems - targeted at minimizing the
          effect of the outlined <span class="bold"><strong>SLOW</strong></span> factors. Everything
          we create for future systems, every design decision we make, every criteria
          we apply, has to be validated against this single, uniform metric. This
          includes changes in the hardware architecture we prevalently use today,
          and it certainly involves new ways of writing software, starting from the
          operating system, runtime system, compilers, and at the application level.
          However the key point is that all those layers have to be co-designed,
          they are interdependent and cannot be seen as separate facets. The systems
          we have today have been evolving for over 50 years now. All layers function
          in a certain way relying on the other layers to do so as well. However,
          we do not have the time to wait for a coherent system to evolve for another
          50 years. The new paradigms are needed now - therefore, co-design is the
          key.
