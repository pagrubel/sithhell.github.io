        Current advances in high performance computing (HPC) continue to suffer from
        the issues plaguing parallel computation. These issues include, but are not
        limited to, ease of programming, inability to handle dynamically changing
        workloads, scalability, and efficient utilization of system resources. Emerging
        technological trends such as multi-core processors further highlight limitations
        of existing parallel computation models. To mitigate the aforementioned problems,
        it is necessary to rethink the approach to parallelization models. ParalleX
        contains mechanisms such as multi-threading, parcels, global name space support,
        percolation and local control objects (LCO). By design, ParalleX overcomes
        limitations of current models of parallelism by alleviating contention, latency,
        overhead and starvation. With ParalleX, it is further possible to increase
        performance by at least an order of magnitude on challenging parallel algorithms,
        e.g., dynamic directed graph algorithms and adaptive mesh refinement methods
        for astrophysics. An additional benefit of ParalleX is fine-grained control
        of power usage, enabling reductions in power consumption.

        ParalleX is a new parallel execution model that offers an alternative to
        the conventional computation models, such as message passing. ParalleX distinguishes
        itself by:

</ul></div>
<p>
        The ParalleX model is intrinsically latency hiding, delivering an abundance
        of variable-grained parallelism within a hierarchical namespace environment.
        The goal of this innovative strategy is to enable future systems delivering
        very high efficiency, increased scalability and ease of programming. ParalleX
        can contribute to significant improvements in the design of all levels of
        computing systems and their usage from application algorithms and their programming
        languages to system architecture and hardware design together with their
        supporting compilers and operating system software.

<p>
        High Performance ParalleX (<span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span>) is the first runtime
        system implementation of the ParalleX execution model. The <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span>
        runtime software package is a modular, feature-complete, and performance
        oriented representation of the ParalleX execution model targeted at conventional
        parallel computing architectures such as SMP nodes and commodity clusters.
        It is academically developed and freely available under an open source license.
        We provide <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span> to the community for experimentation
        and application to achieve high efficiency and scalability for dynamic adaptive
        and irregular computational problems. <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span> is a C++ library
        that supports a set of critical mechanisms for dynamic adaptive resource
        management and lightweight task scheduling within the context of a global
        address space. It is solidly based on many years of experience in writing
        highly parallel applications for HPC systems.
      </p>
<p>
        The two-decade success of the communicating sequential processes (CSP) execution
        model and its message passing interface (MPI) programming model has been
        seriously eroded by challenges of power, processor core complexity, multi-core
        sockets, and heterogeneous structures of GPUs. Both efficiency and scalability
        for some current (strong scaled) applications and future Exascale applications
        demand new techniques to expose new sources of algorithm parallelism and
        exploit unused resources through adaptive use of runtime information.
      </p>
<p>
        The ParalleX execution model replaces CSP to provide a new computing paradigm
        embodying the governing principles for organizing and conducting highly efficient
        scalable computations greatly exceeding the capabilities of today's problems.
        <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span> is the first practical, reliable, and performance-oriented
        runtime system incorporating the principal concepts of the ParalleX model
        publicly provided in open source release form.
